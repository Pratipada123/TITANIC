Task 2 - Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. It aims to uncover insights about the passengers, understand survival patterns, and possibly build predictive models using Python and popular data science libraries.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize patterns and trends
- Prepare the dataset for further modeling (optional)

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which includes information about the passengers such as:

- PassengerId
- Pclass (ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (port of embarkation)
- Survived (target variable)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Place the Titanic dataset CSV file in the appropriate path (`C:/Users/prati/OneDrive/Datafiles/Titanic-Dataset.csv` or update the path in the notebook).
4. Open the notebook `Task_2.ipynb` and run the cells.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
